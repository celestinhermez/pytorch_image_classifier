# PyTorch Image Classifier

This project exemplifies how to build an image classifier using PyTorch. The main
files include at a development notebook, with detailed steps to pre-process images,
train a network, save it and use it for predictions; and a Python app which can be run
from the command line to train a neural network on any dataset of images.

The idea is to make it easy for anyone to build their own image classifier with very 
high accuracy.

## Installation

In order to use this Python app, simply fork and clone the repository for use on your
own computer.

## File Structure

## Usage

Describe the different command line options available, either train on the provided 
dataset or own dataset. 

Describe the checkpoint

## Caveats

Version of PyTorch
Notebook to be opened in Colab, file structure to change
File structure for train and validation dataset
If load a checkpoint, `arch` must be a key with a string with the architecture
 (either resnet152 or VGG16). This could easily be extended
